            <dt class="que">1. Where do I Make Reservations to Stay in Yellowstone?</dt>
            <dd class="ans invisible">Yellowstone National Park Lodges operates the nine lodges in the park. All are open
                from late spring
                through fall, but only two are open in the winter: Old Faithful Snow Lodge and Mammoth Hot Springs
                Hotel. Be sure to make a reservation early!
            </dd>

            <dt class="que">2. How did Yellowstone get its name?</dt>
            <dd class="ans invisible">Yellowstone National Park is named after the Yellowstone River, the major river
                running through the
                park. According to French-Canadian trappers in the 1800s, they asked the name of the river from the
                Minnetaree tribe, who live in what is now eastern Montana. They responded “Mi tse a-da-zi,” which
                literally translates as “Rock Yellow River.” The trappers translated this into French as “Roche Jaune”
                or “Pierre Jaune.” In 1797, explorer-geographer David Thompson used the English translation—“Yellow
                Stone.” Lewis and Clark called the Yellowstone River by the French and English forms. Subsequent use
                formalized the name as “Yellowstone.

            <dt class="que">3. Is Yellowstone the largest national park?</dt>
            <dd class="ans invisible">No. More than half of Alaska’s national park units are larger, including Wrangell–St.
                Elias National Park and Preserve, which is the largest unit (13 million acres) in the National Park
                System. Until 1994, Yellowstone (at 2.2 million acres) was the largest national park in the contiguous
                United States. That year Death Valley National Monument was expanded and became a national park—it has
                more than 3 million acres.

            <dt class="que">4. Is Yellowstone the most visited national park?</dt>
            <dd class="ans invisible">Yellowstone is in the top five national parks for number of recreational visitors.
                Great Smoky Mountains National Park often has the most. Visit https://irma.nps.gov/Stats/ to view
                up-to-date statistics for all national parks.
            </dd>

            <dt class="que">5. What is the difference between a national park and a national forest?</dt>
            <dd class="ans invisible">National parks are administered by the Department of the Interior and national forests
                by the Department of Agriculture. The National Park Service is mandated to preserve resources
                unimpaired, while the Forest Service is mandated to wisely manage resources for many sustainable uses.
                Six national forests surround Yellowstone National Park.
            </dd>

            <dt class="que">6. How many rangers work in Yellowstone?</dt>
            <dd class="ans invisible">Approximately 738 people work for the National Park Service during the peak summer
                season. Approximately 386 are permanent, year-round employees. Park rangers work in education, resource
                management, law enforcement, emergency medical services, and backcountry operations. Other employees
                specialize in research, maintenance, management, administration, trail maintenance, fire management, and
                fee collection.
            </dd>

            <dt class="que">7. How do you become a park ranger?</dt>
            <dd class="ans invisible">Many National Park Service employees begin their careers as volunteers or as seasonal
                employees. Hiring is very competitive and is conducted through the Office of Personnel Management. Learn
                more about working with us.
            </dd>

            <dt class="que">8. Can we swim in rivers and lakes?</dt>
            <dd class="ans invisible">Swimming is not recommended because most lakes and streams are dangerously cold.
                Firehole Canyon, near Madison Junction, has a swimming area popular in summer. Soaking in thermal
                features is illegal. The area known as the Boiling River, north of Mammoth Hot Springs, allows soaking
                in the Gardner River near thermal outflow, but not in the feature itself. Soaking is allowed during
                daylight hours only and at your own risk.
            </dd>

            <dt class="que">9. What is the highest peak in the park?</dt>
            <dd class="ans invisible">Eagle Peak in the southeastern part of Yellowstone is the highest at 11,358 feet.</dd>

            <dt class="que">10. Why is Yellowstone called a biosphere reserve and a world heritage site?</dt>
            <dd class="ans invisible">The United Nations designated Yellowstone National Park as a biosphere reserve and a
                world heritage site in recognition of the worldwide significance of its natural and cultural resources.
